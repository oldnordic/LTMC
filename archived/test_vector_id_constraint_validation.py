Comprehensive Vector ID Constraint Validation Test Suite
========================================================

Phase 4 deployment testing for vector ID constraint fix validation.
Tests the complete resolution of "UNIQUE constraint failed: ResourceChunks.vector_id" errors.

DEPLOYMENT STATUS VALIDATION:
✅ Phase 1 COMPLETE: Database health checks fixed for all services
✅ Phase 2 COMPLETE: FAISS service integrated with database sequence  
✅ Phase 3 COMPLETE: VectorIdSequence table exists in schema
🔄 Phase 4 IN PROGRESS: Comprehensive validation testing

CRITICAL VALIDATION POINTS:
- Zero "UNIQUE constraint failed: ResourceChunks.vector_id" errors
- All database services showing healthy status
- FAISS vector IDs generated from database sequence, not index.ntotal
- Concurrent operations work without conflicts
- Memory storage and code pattern logging fully operational

Test Categories:
1. System Integration Tests - Verify server endpoints work
2. Database Sequence Tests - Validate VectorIdSequence table operations
3. FAISS Service Tests - Test vector ID generation uses database sequence
4. Memory Storage Tests - Test operations that previously failed with constraint violations
5. Concurrent Operations Tests - Test for race conditions
6. Health Validation Tests - Ensure all services report healthy status
