# Local Agent Development Rules

## Code Standards
- Write production-ready, testable code
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add detailed docstrings and comments
- Use type hints for Python
- Follow SOLID principles

## Implementation Strategy
- Build incrementally and test each piece
- Create modular, loosely-coupled components
- Include database schema validation
- Add proper logging throughout
- Make everything configurable

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for each class
- Test database operations thoroughly
- Mock external dependencies (ollama, subprocess)
- Test error conditions and edge cases

## When implementing:
1. Always ask for clarification before making assumptions
2. Show me the interface/API before implementing
3. Test each module independently
4. Don't move to next module until current one works
