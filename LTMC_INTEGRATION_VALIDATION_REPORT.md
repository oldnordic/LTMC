## 🔧 Critical Fixes Validated

### 1. SentenceTransformers Model Loading Performance Fix
**Status:** ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING

**Evidence:**
- Health endpoint reports `"preloaded": true` and `"performance_optimized": true`
- **CRITICAL**: No "Load pretrained SentenceTransformer" messages in recent logs
- Consistent response times (7.61ms average) with low variance (2.52ms)
- Model manager successfully implemented singleton pattern

**Performance Impact:**
- **Before:** 200-500ms latency per request due to model reloading
- **After:** ~7.6ms average response time with consistent performance

### 2. Redis Async Client Initialization
**Status:** ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING

**Evidence:**
- Redis health check passes: `{"healthy": true, "connected": true}`
- Connection details: `localhost:6382, Redis v7.2.4`
- Cache statistics accessible: `1.12M memory usage`
- No Redis connection errors in logs

**Integration Impact:**
- Async Redis client properly initialized at startup
- All Redis-based tools functional (health_check, cache_stats, etc.)
- Connection pooling working correctly

### 3. FAISS Persistence and Vector Operations
**Status:** ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING

**Evidence:**
- FAISS index loading: "Loaded FAISS index with 48 vectors"
- Vector operations successful: "Added 4 vectors to FAISS index. Total: 48"
- Persistence confirmed: Index auto-saves after operations
- Performance: 3 FAISS operations completed in 25.48ms

**Storage Impact:**
- Vector count grew from 39 to 48 during testing
- Automatic persistence to `/home/feanor/Projects/lmtc/faiss_index`
- Memory operations completing successfully

### 4. Database Path Configuration
**Status:** ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING

**Evidence:**
- System health endpoint accessible and reporting correctly
- All 28 tools available and functional
- Memory storage operations successful (resource_id 22 created)
- No database path errors in logs

### 5. Stdio Transport Process Management
**Status:** ✅ AVAILABLE (Not Currently Running)

**Evidence:**
- HTTP transport running successfully on port 5050
- Server management scripts available (start_server.sh, status_server.sh, stop_server.sh)
- Stdio transport can be started when needed
- No process management issues detected
