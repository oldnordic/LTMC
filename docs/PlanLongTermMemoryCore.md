Project Plan: Long-Term Memory Core (LTMC)Version: 1.0Date: August 7, 20251. IntroductionThis document outlines the architecture, tech stack, dataflow, and development roadmap for creating the Long-Term Memory Core (LTMC) server. The primary goal of this project is to provide a persistent, searchable context memory for AI applications, accessible via a modular and scalable REST API. The system will store documents, code, and chat histories, allowing an AI to retrieve relevant information dynamically to maintain long-term context.2. Core Principles for AI ImplementationThis project must be developed following strict guidelines to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clarity. The AI developer (e.g., Cursor) must adhere to the following principles:Modularity: Every Python file (.py) must not exceed 300 lines of code. Functionality must be broken down into smaller, single-responsibility modules and classes.Separation of Concerns: The application logic must be clearly separated into distinct layers: Presentation (API), Business Logic (Services), and Persistence (Data Access). These layers will reside in separate directories.API-First Design: The API Specification is the primary contract for this application. All development will be guided by implementing the defined endpoints and their associated data schemas.Strict Type Hinting: All function definitions, class methods, and critical variables must use Python's type hints for clarity, editor support, and automated validation.Configuration Management: No hardcoded values. All configuration (e.g., model names, file paths, database names) must be managed through environment variables.
