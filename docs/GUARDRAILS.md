# LTMC Quality Guardrails and Standards

## Overview

The LTMC project enforces comprehensive quality guardrails to ensure code excellence, system reliability, and maintainability. These guardrails are automatically enforced through hooks, CI/CD pipeline validation, and comprehensive quality gates.

## Core Quality Principles

### 1. Quality Over Speed (Non-Negotiable)
- **Mandate**: User explicitly requires quality over speed - NO exceptions
- **Implementation**: No shortcuts, stubs, mocks, placeholders, or `pass` statements allowed
- **Enforcement**: Automated detection and rejection of low-quality implementations
- **Testing Requirement**: All functionality must be tested before claiming completion

### 2. Real Functionality Only
- **Prohibition**: No mock implementations, fake responses, or simulated behavior in production
- **Requirement**: All features must demonstrate actual system functionality with concrete evidence
- **Validation**: Real database operations, actual API calls, verified file system interactions
- **Testing**: Integration tests with actual system components, no mocked dependencies

### 3. Zero Technical Debt Tolerance
- **Anti-Bandaid Development**: No `file_proper`, `file_fixed`, `file_v2` - fix the real file
- **Single Source of Truth**: One authoritative document per topic, no duplicate variants
- **Monolithic Prevention**: Maximum 300 lines per file, enforce smart modularization
- **Consolidation Requirement**: No multiple scripts doing the same function

## Quality Gates System

### Automated Quality Enforcement
The LTMC project implements a comprehensive quality gates system that enforces all standards automatically:

#### 1. Mock Detection (Zero Tolerance)
- **Tool**: Enhanced AST and text pattern analysis
- **Scope**: All production code (`ltms/`)
- **Enforcement**: Zero mock implementations allowed
- **Detection Patterns**:
  - Import statements: `import mock`, `from unittest.mock`
  - Decorators: `@mock.patch`, `@patch`
  - Instantiations: `MagicMock()`, `Mock()`
  - Method calls: `.return_value`, `.side_effect`
- **CI/CD Integration**: Pipeline fails on any mock detection

#### 2. Performance SLA Monitoring
- **Database Operations**: <15ms response time requirement
- **Vector Search**: <25ms similarity search requirement
- **Graph Queries**: <20ms traversal operations requirement
- **Cache Operations**: <5ms key-value operations requirement
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB total consumption limit
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking with SLA validation

#### 3. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum Coverage**: 85% code coverage required
- **Test Types**: Unit, integration, performance, and compliance tests
- **Success Rate**: ≥95% test success rate requirement
- **Real Testing**: No mocked components in integration tests
- **Validation**: Comprehensive coverage reporting with gap analysis

#### 4. Code Quality Standards
- **Formatting**: Black formatting compliance (line-length=88)
- **Import Sorting**: isort with Black profile compatibility
- **Linting**: flake8 compliance with custom rules
- **Quality Score**: 8.0/10 minimum quality score requirement
- **Security**: Zero high-severity vulnerabilities (Bandit scanning)

## Implementation Standards

### 1. No Mock/Stub/Placeholder Code
**Prohibited Patterns:**
```python
# ❌ FORBIDDEN - Mock implementations
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
mock_service = MagicMock()

# ❌ FORBIDDEN - Stub implementations  
def process_data():
    pass  # TODO: Implement later

# ❌ FORBIDDEN - Fake responses
def get_user_data():
    return {"fake": "data"}  # Simulated response

# ❌ FORBIDDEN - Placeholder implementations
def save_to_database(data):
    print("Would save to database")  # Not actually saving
    return True
```

**Required Patterns:**
```python
# ✅ REQUIRED - Real implementations
def save_to_database(data):
    """Save data to actual database with error handling."""
    try:
        conn = get_db_connection()
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO table (data) VALUES (?)", (data,))
        conn.commit()
        return True
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        logger.error(f"Database save failed: {e}")
        raise DatabaseError(f"Failed to save data: {e}")

# ✅ REQUIRED - Real API interactions
async def fetch_external_data(url: str):
    """Fetch data from actual external API."""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling
**Required Standards:**
- All operations must have proper exception handling
- Specific exception types for different error conditions
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance

### 3. Real Integration Testing
**Testing Requirements:**
- All database operations tested with actual database connections
- API integrations tested with real endpoints or test servers
- File system operations tested with actual file creation/modification
- Performance testing with real workloads and data volumes
- End-to-end workflow validation with all components

## Hook System Implementation

### Pre-Commit Hooks
The project implements comprehensive pre-commit validation:

#### 1. Mock Detection Hook
- **Trigger**: Before each commit
- **Action**: Scan all modified files for mock patterns
- **Result**: Block commit if mocks detected
- **Feedback**: Detailed violation report with line numbers

#### 2. Quality Validation Hook
- **Trigger**: Before each commit
- **Validation**: Code formatting, import sorting, linting
- **Performance**: Quick validation for immediate feedback
- **Result**: Block commit if quality standards not met

#### 3. Test Execution Hook
- **Trigger**: Before major commits
- **Action**: Run relevant test suite for modified components
- **Performance**: Focused testing for rapid feedback
- **Result**: Block commit if tests fail

### CI/CD Pipeline Enforcement
