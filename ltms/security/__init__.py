LTMC Security Module

Phase 1 Security Implementation:
- Project isolation for multi-tenant operation
- Path security validation and sanitization
- Attack vector prevention (path traversal, code injection, etc.)

Performance Requirements:
- Project validation: <5ms
- Path validation: <3ms
- Combined overhead: <10ms total

Security Coverage:
- Path traversal prevention
- Code injection blocking  
- System file access protection
- Input sanitization
- Unicode attack prevention
